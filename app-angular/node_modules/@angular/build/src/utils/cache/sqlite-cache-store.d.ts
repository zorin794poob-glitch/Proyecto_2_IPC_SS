/**
 * A persistent cache store backed by SQLite.
 *
 * Values are persisted with the V8 structured clone serialization API instead of JSON. Cached
 * values include binary data such as the `Uint8Array` output of the JavaScript transformer and
 * the `contents` of an esbuild load result. A JSON round-trip converts those into plain objects
 * (`{"0":105,"1":109,...}`), which breaks consumers on any build that reads them back from disk.
