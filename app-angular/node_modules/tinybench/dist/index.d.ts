   *
   * Each sample is measured as `t1 - t0` around a single call to the task
   * function, so every raw sample is inflated by approximately one
   * timestamp provider call cost `C`. When this option is `true`, an
   * estimate `Ĉ` is computed once at construction time via
   * {@link calibrateTimerOverhead}, and `max(0, raw_sample - Ĉ)` is used
   * in place of each non-overridden sample before statistics are computed.
   *
   * **Statistics after correction.** Statistics use the final samples, after
   * correction and any duration overrides. When all latency samples are
   * timer-measured and exceed `Ĉ`, subtracting the constant shifts location
   * statistics by `Ĉ` while leaving variance and absolute dispersion unchanged
   * apart from rounding. Relative error can increase as the mean decreases.
   *
   * When samples clamp to zero, these translation rules no longer hold.
   * Quantiles are interpolated: exactly half zero samples need not give a
   * zero median, and a zero median does not imply zero mean absolute deviation.
   * Prefer `overriddenDuration` for sub-overhead measurements.
   *
   * **Three observable consequences of the clamp.**
   *
   * 1. `latency.min` may be exactly `0` even when no zero-duration sample
   *    was actually observed.
   * 2. The throughput estimator substitutes `1000 / latency.mean` (or `0`
   *    when `mean === 0`) for every clamped sample.
   * 3. {@link detectTimerSaturation} criterion `'zero-dominated'` cannot
   *    distinguish clamped samples from genuine zero-duration timer
   *    reads, so a `'warning'` event may be dispatched in the
   *    sub-overhead regime even when the timer itself is not saturated.
   *
   * **Caveat — `concurrency: "task"`.** The overhead is calibrated once
   * at construction time with sequential timer calls. Setting both
   * options causes the constructor (and `run()`) to throw, since the
   * sequentially-calibrated estimate would not reflect the per-iteration
   * timer call cost under concurrent execution.
   *
   * **Caveat — `overriddenDuration`.** Samples returned by the task
   * function via `overriddenDuration` are intentional user values and
   * are never modified by the correction. They are also excluded from
   * {@link Task.detectedResolution} and from timer-saturation detection.
